# Product Requirements Document: Chrome Extension for Dynamic Script Execution

## Introduction/Overview

This Chrome extension enables users to interact with any website through natural language commands. Users can request modifications, automations, or information extraction, and the extension will generate and execute JavaScript code to fulfill these requests. The extension features a collapsible sidebar with a chat interface powered by Claude AI, allowing for conversational interaction and script generation.

## Goals

1. Enable users to modify any website's appearance or behavior through natural language commands
2. Automate repetitive tasks like form filling across any website
3. Provide navigation assistance and content summarization capabilities
4. Create a reusable toolbox of scripts that can be saved and applied later
5. Offer a seamless, non-technical user experience for website manipulation

## User Stories

1. **As a user**, I want to change the visual appearance of any website (e.g., background color, font size) so that I can customize my browsing experience.
2. **As a job seeker**, I want to automatically fill out job applications using my saved information so that I can apply to multiple positions quickly.
3. **As a user navigating complex websites**, I want step-by-step guidance with visual overlays so that I can complete tasks without confusion.
4. **As a content consumer**, I want to summarize and chat about YouTube videos or long articles so that I can quickly understand key points.
5. **As a power user**, I want to save and reuse scripts I've created so that I can build a personal automation toolbox.
6. **As a user**, I want to reference content from other tabs in my queries so that I can provide better context to the AI.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Extension Activation**
   - The extension must show/hide a right-side sidebar when the extension icon is clicked
   - The sidebar must maintain its state (open/closed) within the same browsing session
   - The sidebar must be injectable into any website without breaking the site's functionality

2. **Chat Interface**
   - The system must provide a chat interface in the sidebar using Next.js for smooth UI
   - The chat must connect to Claude API for natural language processing
   - The chat must maintain conversation history within the session
   - The chat must support text input initially (voice to be added later)

3. **Tab Context Integration**
   - The system must allow users to reference other open tabs using '@' mentions
   - When typing '@', a dropdown must show all open tabs
   - Selected tab content must be included as context in the AI query

4. **Script Generation and Management**
   - The AI must generate JavaScript code based on user requests
   - Generated scripts must be displayed in a preview before execution
   - Scripts must be saveable with user-defined names for later use
   - The system must maintain a script library/toolbox accessible across sessions

5. **Script Execution**
   - Scripts must have full access to the current page's DOM
   - The extension must execute scripts in the context of the current tab
   - Script execution must be immediate upon user approval
   - The system must handle script errors gracefully and report them to the user

6. **Security and Permissions**
   - The extension must show script preview before execution
   - Users must explicitly approve script execution
   - The system must implement a basic permission system for different operation types

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. Cross-site scripting or sharing data between different domains
2. Automated financial transactions or purchases
3. Modifying browser settings outside of web page content
4. Undo/rollback functionality for executed scripts (initial version)
5. Multi-browser support (Chrome only initially)
6. Offline functionality

## Design Considerations

- **UI Framework**: Next.js for the sidebar interface with modern, clean design
- **Sidebar Position**: Right-side collapsible sidebar
- **Chat UI**: Standard chat interface with message bubbles, input field at bottom
- **Script Preview**: Code editor view with syntax highlighting
- **Tab Selector**: Dropdown/autocomplete component for '@' mentions
- **Visual Design**: Modern, minimal interface that doesn't clash with website designs

## Technical Considerations

1. **Architecture**:
   - Chrome Extension Manifest V3
   - Content script for DOM manipulation
   - Background service worker for tab management
   - Next.js app embedded as extension sidebar
   - Vite + React for build process

2. **API Integration**:
   - Claude API for AI capabilities (placeholder for API key in config)
   - Message passing between content script, background, and sidebar

3. **Storage**:
   - Chrome storage API for script library
   - Session storage for conversation history
   - Local storage for user preferences

4. **Build Process**:
   - Webpack/Vite configuration to bundle all assets
   - Proper handling of CSS and static assets
   - Development and production builds

## Success Metrics

1. **Speed**: Script generation completes within 3 seconds for simple requests
2. **Accuracy**: 90% of generated scripts work correctly on first execution
3. **Usability**: Users can go from request to execution in under 30 seconds
4. **Adoption**: 80% of users save at least one script for reuse
5. **Engagement**: Average of 5+ script executions per user session

## Open Questions

1. How should we handle scripts that require authentication or user-specific data?
2. Should scripts be shareable between users in future versions?
3. What's the maximum complexity/length for generated scripts?
4. How should we handle website-specific edge cases or restrictions?
5. Should we implement script versioning for saved scripts?

## Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1**: Basic extension structure with collapsible sidebar
2. **Phase 2**: Chat interface with Claude API integration
3. **Phase 3**: Tab context with '@' mentions
4. **Phase 4**: Script generation and preview
5. **Phase 5**: Script execution on current page
6. **Phase 6**: Script library/toolbox
7. **Phase 7**: Voice interaction (future)
