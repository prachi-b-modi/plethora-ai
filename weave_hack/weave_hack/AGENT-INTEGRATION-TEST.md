# Testing Agent Integration in Chrome Extension

## Prerequisites

1. **Start the Agent Server**
   ```bash
   cd automate
   npm run agent-server
   ```
   
   You should see:
   ```
   ðŸ¤– Stagehand Agent Server
   ðŸ“¡ HTTP API: http://localhost:3456
   ðŸ”Œ WebSocket: ws://localhost:3456
   ```

2. **Load the Chrome Extension**
   - Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select the `dist/` directory

## Testing Steps

### 1. Basic Connection Test
1. Click the extension icon to open the sidebar
2. Click on the "Automation" tab
3. Check the connection indicator (should show green "Connected")

### 2. Simple Automation Test
Try these example tasks:

**Test 1: Google Search**
```
Go to google.com and search for "Chrome extensions development"
```

**Test 2: Screenshot**
```
Navigate to github.com and take a screenshot of the homepage
```

**Test 3: Multi-step Task**
```
Go to wikipedia.org, search for "artificial intelligence", and extract the first paragraph
```

### 3. Features to Verify

- [ ] Connection status indicator works

- [ ] Real-time progress updates appear
- [ ] Screenshots are displayed in the task details
- [ ] Task status changes (pending â†’ running â†’ completed)

### 4. Troubleshooting
